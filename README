This repo is a collection of utility classes that I often use when creating small business websites. Things like:

  - "Contact Us" form validation
  - Basic slideshow functionality
  - Basic lightbox functionality


= The Story =

Basically, I got tired of searching for a variety of jQuery plugins that did what I wanted. Every time I did this, I had to modify the JavaScript or CSS to do what I wanted.
